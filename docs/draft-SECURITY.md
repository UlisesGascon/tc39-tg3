# TC39 Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## Reporting Guidelines

- If a security issue is present in an implementation, then [report it directly](#reporting-to-projects) to the relevant project.
- If a security issue is present in a TC39 specification, [let us know](#reporting-to-tc39).
  - Include any relevant links to corroborative information, e.g. vulnerability reports, reference IDs, etc.
- If you are unable to determine whether a security issue is implementation-specific, [let us know](#reporting-to-tc39).

## Reporting to TC39

- GitHub private vulnerability reporting (add link when available)
- Send an email to `security@tc39.es`
