# TC39 Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

First, determine whether the vulnerability is present in a TC39 specification (e.g. ECMA-262, ECMA-402) rather than an implementation (e.g. SpiderMonkey, V8). If the vulnerability is implementation-specific, then report it directly to the relevant project using their vulnerability reporting process.

If the vulnerability is present in a TC39 specification, or if you are unable to determine whether it is implementation-specific, then report it using one of these methods:

- GitHub private vulnerability reporting (add link when available)
- Send an email to `TC39Chairs@ecma-international.org`
