# TC39 Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## Reporting Guidelines

- If the vulnerability is present in an implementation, then [report it directly](#reporting-a-vulnerability-to-projects) to the relevant project using their vulnerability reporting process.
- If the vulnerability is present in a TC39 specification, [let us know](#reporting-a-vulnerability-to-tc39).
  - Include any relevant links to corroborative information, e.g. vulnerability reports, reference IDs, etc.
- If you are unable to determine whether the vulnerability is implementation-specific, [let us know](#reporting-a-vulnerability-to-tc39).
